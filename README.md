# Metal-Gear-Solid-Demake
This project is a demake inspired by the Metal Gear series.
This was mage as part of a group project for the UWE Games-Technology course.

Contributions to the project included the creation of a grid tool where areas of the map could be marked as travarsable and the integration of the A* pathfinding algorithm for the npc navigation.
